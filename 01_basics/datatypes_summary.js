1. Primitive- call by value,there is reference provided when we call the value only the copy is provided  and we make changes to the copy


// there are 7: String,boolean,number,null,undefined,symbol(when want to make something unique),Bigint




2. Non-Primitive or Reference Type-when we are given reference value when called upon
//there total 3- array,function,objects
